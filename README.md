# U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Costs-Analysis
A data analysis that I did on the US medical insurance using Python and its libraries like pandas and matplotlib

# Questions that the analysis answered and helped to visualize them
1. How many men are smokers, and also how many women are smokers.
2. The percentage of people that smoke and of those that do not smoker.
3. Do older people have higher BMI than young people. It was visualized using a scatter plot.
4. The summary statistics(mean, mode, median) of each variable eg (age, bmi)

# Notebook used
